## Take care secrets and credentials in repositories

<img align="right" width="180" height="200" src="/document/assets/images/Cred scanning.png">
<em>How can you ensure that sensitive information are not pushed to a repository?</em>

This is one of the [OWASP Top Ten issues](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) and
several bug bounties write-ups are related to this kind of issue, eg hard-coded credentials pushed by mistake.

You should scan your commits and your repository, and detect any sensitive information such as password, secret key, confidential, etc.
following the process shown in the picture.
<br/>

The ideal approach is detecting and preventing the exposure of sensitive data before that they hit the repository,
because they are then visible in the history. In case of code hosting platforms, secrets can still linger 
on the web and be searchable after you remove them from the repository.

A complimentary approach is scanning the repo for sensitive information, and then remove them;
note that when a credential is leaked, it is already compromised and should be invalidated.

Here are some helpful tools to automatically scan repositories for sensitive information.
Scans can be implemented directly in our pipeline, and be repeatable and efficient.Â
