### Static scanning is an important part of the proces!
<img align="right" width="360" height="200" src="/document/assets/images/Static scanning.png">
Static Code Analysis or Source Code Analysis is usually part of a Code Review (white-box testing) and it is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program.</br>
Static scanning is good way finding coding issues such as:

+ Syntax violations
+ Security vulnerabilities
+ Programming errors
+ Coding standard violations
+ Undefined values

For more information about the Static Code Analysis please visit [the OWASP page](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Static_Code_Analysis)
To achieve a better result we can combine static security scanning and 3rd party code (open-source libraries (dependency)) scanning.

- #### Tools (Static Code Analysis):
  + **SonarQube** It is an open-source web-based tool, extending its coverage to more than 20 languages, and also allows a number of plugins. [HomePage](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
  + **Veracode** Veracode is a static analysis tool that is built on the SaaS model. This tool is mainly used to analyze the code from a security point of view. [HomePage](https://www.veracode.com/security/static-analysis-tool)

- #### Tools (Dependency scanning): 
  + **OWASP Dependency-check** Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a projectâ€™s dependencies. It supports Java, .NET, JavaScript, and Ruby. [Home Page](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)
  + **RetireJS** RetireJS is an open-source, JavaScript-specific dependency checker. [GitRepo](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js)
  + **Hakiri** Hakiri is a commercial tool that offers dependency checking for Ruby and Rails-based GitHub projects using static code analysis. [HomePage](https://hakiri.io/)
