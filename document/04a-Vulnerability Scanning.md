### Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer, application, endpoints, and IT infrastructure (including network) to identify security holes.

Performing vulnerability scanning is a common requirements for regulatory compliance and can help to minimize an organization's cybersecurity risk. An Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV), for example, is a service provider that is certified and authorized by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) to scan payment card networks.

There are two approaches to vulnerability scanning : 
1. authenticated scans.
2. unauthenticated scans. 

In the **unauthenticated method**, the tester performs the scan as an intruder would, **without trusted access to the network**. Such a scan reveals vulnerabilities that can be accessed without logging into the network. 

In an **authenticated scan**, the tester **logs in as a network user**, revealing the vulnerabilities that are accessible to a trusted user, or an intruder that has gained access as a trusted user.
