# OWASP DevSecOps Guideline
The OWASP DevSecOps Guideline focuses on explaining how we can implement a secure pipeline and using best practices and introduce tools that we can use in this matter.
This project helps any companies in each size that have development pipeline or in other words have DevOps pipeline.
During this project, we try to draw a perspective of a secure DevOps pipeline and then improve it based on our customized requirements.
